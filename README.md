# Eye Candy

**Note.** This project is currently in a state of flux while it is being ported to the Electron framework. The [old project](old/README.md) is still around and can be found in the `old` folder.

**Licenses.** This project is proprietary (unlicensed) and owned by the University of Washington.

All frameworks used here are released under the permissive MIT license: Electron, Electron React Boilerplate, React, Redux, React Router, Webpack, and React Hot Loader.

## Data types

The are five types of data generated by the Eye Candy system:

1. Calibration: System latencies as measured by a calibration process.
2. Program: Stimulation sequence written in the Eye Candy programming language.
3. Sequence: Series of programs that are run sequentially.
4. Study: High-level construct used to group experiments.
5. Experiment: A run of a single program or a sequence of programs.

These can be further divided into two categories:

1. System-wide: Data that are accessible by all users of the system.
   a. Calibrations
   b. Stock programs (read-only)
   c. Stock sequences (read-only)
2. User-specific: Data that are associated with a specific user. The ability of users to see and edit one another's data is handled by the OS.
   a. Studies
   b. Custom programs
   c. Custom sequences
   d. Experiments

## File system

The user specifies a root folder where all Eye Candy data will be stored:

root = /home/sclaggett/eyecandy

All experiments for a given day will be stored in a single directory along with the data captured by the MEA system:

${root}/2020-08-04/Experiment1.txt
  ${root}/2020-08-04/Experiment2.txt
${root}/2020-08-04/Experiment3.txt
  ${root}/2020-08-04/[MEA files]

Studies and custom programs and sequences are stored by name in the following subdirectories:

${root}/studies/${study name}.txt
${root}/programs/${program name}.txt
${root}/sequences/${sequence name}.txt

## Type parameters

Each data type listed above has an array of key-value pairs associated with it. Each of these values is of a specific type, can be set by the user, may have a default, and may be limited to certain options. The supported value types are:

- string: Single line of text
- text: Multiple lines of text
- number: Real number
- date: Calendar date
- time: Time of day
- path: Location on the file system
- dropdown: List of options
- array: Array of items that share a common key set
